# End-to-End-ML-Pipelines-with-Azure-ML-Studio
End-to-End Machine Learning Pipelines with Azure Machine Learning Studio

## Overview

This repository contains three machine learning projects, each demonstrating the development of an end-to-end pipeline using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio with no coding required, all built, deployed, and tested within Azure's user-friendly interface. The projects include:

&nbsp;&nbsp; 1- Automobile Price Prediction (Regression)

&nbsp;&nbsp; 2- Diabetes Prediction (Classification)

&nbsp;&nbsp; 3- Penguin Clustering (Clustering)

Each project is documented in its respective PDF file, including:

&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - **Azure Workspace and Compute Setup:** Configured the Azure Machine Learning workspace and allocated compute resources.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - **Pipeline Development:** Built and evaluated a regression model using Azure's drag-and-drop interface.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - **Inference Pipeline:** Created an inference pipeline for real-time price predictions.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - **Deployment:** Deployed the predictive service to an Azure Container Instance.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 - **Testing:** Verified the model's accuracy by testing predictions based on automobile characteristics.

## Datasets

The datasets used in these projects are available in this repository, provided from the following sources:

- **Automobile Price Data (Raw):** This dataset, used for regression, is provided from the sample datasets in Azure ML Designer.

- **Diabetes Data:** The dataset used for classification was downloaded from link1.

- **Penguin Data:** The dataset used for clustering was downloaded from link2.
